    // HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).
    
    // HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.


    // The DOM Programming Interface
        // The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).
        // In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.
        // The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.
        // A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).
        // A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).


    // *** getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property. ***
