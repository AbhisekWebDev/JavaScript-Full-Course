    <h3>Synchronous JS VS Asynchronous JS</h3>
    <p>
        Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another. Tasks can run simultaneously. <br>
        Synchronous is a blocking architecture, so the execution of each operation is dependent on the completion of the one before it
